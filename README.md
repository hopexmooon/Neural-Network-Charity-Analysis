# Neural Network Charity Analysis


### Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this activity is to use Machine Learning and Neural Networks to create a binary classifier. This will give us the capabilities to predict whether applicants will be sucessful if funded by Alphabet Soup. The csv contains 34,000 organizations that have recieved funding. From this dataset we will:

1. Preprocess the data for a Neural Network Model
2. Complie, Train, and Evaluate the Model
3. Optomize the Model 

### Results: 

Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

We decided to use "IS_SUCCESSFUL" as a target for the model

- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

We used every model except the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column as a feature.

- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

EIN and NAME were two variables that neighter target nor features

### Summary: 

Unfortunately, tensorflow was unable to download to my computer. This left me unable to accomplish Delivereable 2 and 3. I will keep working on fixing it to complete Deliverable 2 and 3.
